  <h1>Random Poem</h1>

    <p>When some aliens talk about money
    They speak if it were a mysterious lover
    Who went out to buy almond milk and never
    Came back, and it makes me nostalgic
    For the years I lived on nachos and cheese,
    Hungry all the time, scootering to work on everyday
    Like a woman journeying for alcohol
    From a townhouse without a well, then living
    One or two nights like everyone else
    On roast chicken and chocolate milk.</p>
